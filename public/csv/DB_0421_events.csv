20,Hotel Alexandra History,1872,4/17/1872,"On April 17, 1872 the site of the Alexandra was purchased by Caleb Clark Walworth,  a member of Boston's wealthy new class of businessmen who established their fortunes in manufacturing during the middle years of the nineteenth century.  With his brother James J. Walworth, he controlled a series of corporations that produced the first steam-heating systems in the world, a revolutionary system that James had invented. 

 

Caleb Walworth and his brother James were natives of Canaan, New Hampshire who had followed their fortunes to Boston.  James was the first to come to Boston, arriving in 1828 at the age of 20, working in the hardware business.  He married a Bostonian, Elizabeth Chickering Nason, and in June of 1841 founded a new business with Elizabeth's brother Joseph.  Starting in New York City, and almost immediately opening an office in Boston, Walworth & Nason expanded on the work of British inventor Angier M. Perkins, who had invented a hot water apparatus for the heating of buildings.  James Walworth's contribution was to adapt this wrought-iron tube apparatus to heat with steam, something that had never been done before. 

In short order, Walworth also invented the first mechanical, steam-driven ventilating fan.  This new combination of efficient, reliable heat and fresh air was an immediate success, and the first large-scale application was in 1846 at the magnificent new United States Custom House in Boston, designed in the Greek Revival style by noted architect Ammi B.

21,Empty Site ,1874,,"The site of the Alexandra was a lot on the original Boston Neck that was never developed while the South End grew up around it. By 1874 it was a conspicuously empty corner on a major intersection, the other three corners being occupied by elegant row houses.  That block of Massachusetts Avenue was known during the nineteenth century as Chester Square (although the actual square was two blocks north of it), and had a pretty green mall with double rows of trees running down the center.  Across the mall was the Samuel Bowman house, a very large and elaborate brownstone-faced house with a rooftop observatory.  The history of the Hotel Alexandra itself, however, really begins with a family named Walworth, and their name is inextricably linked with it. ",Hotel Alexandra,"1767 Washington Street, Boston, MA 02118",42.3363992,71.07744687,"Written by John Neale, Historian for the South End Historical Society",https://northeastern-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/velloreumashankar_y_northeastern_edu/Documents/INAM5983%20Interdisciplinary%20Special%20Topics%20-%20Mass%20Ave%20Coalition/History/Alexandra%20History/Hotel%20Alexandra%20-%20History%20John%20Neale.docx?d=w7ac2389c9a9647209da27b735674f9b5&csf=1&web=1&e=hmd6Uf,,
22,Construction of the Hotel Alexandra,1874,,"The Walworth Manufacturing Company, which had been organized in 1872, survived the great financial ""Panic of 1873"" due in large part to Caleb Walworth's guidance. By 1874 Caleb was in such a strong financial position he undertook to build on his recently purchased corner lot on Washington Street, and by September of 1875 the ""Hotel Alexandra"" was completed.

Why Caleb Walworth chose to build a residential ""hotel"" is not known today, but it must have appeared at the time to be a good investment in a form of housing that was just becoming popular. ""French flats"", as they were also known at the time, were still a fairly novel new form of urban housing.  Living in an apartment that occupied all or part of only one floor of a building had been made technologically possible by the recent invention of the elevator. The St. Cloud on Tremont Street, designed by Nathaniel J. Bradlee and completed in 1869 was one of the first of the South End's exclusively residential hotels, and by 1875 there were still only a small number in Boston. Some, like the very large Commonwealth Hotel on Washington Street (between West Springfield and Worcester Streets) also served as hotels in the modern sense, offering temporary lodging to out-of-town visitors.

The Alexandra was conceived, like the St. Cloud, as an exclusively residential hotel on a small scale. Like the St. Cloud, it had two commercial spaces at the street level that flanked the residential entrance. The similarity to the St. Cloud continued on the upper floors, where each of the four upper floors was divided into two apartments. The difference was that in the St. Cloud each apartment ran from front to back, while at the Alexandra one apartment stretched across the front of the building, while the other occupied the entire rear.

In its exterior design the Alexandra was a forward-looking building designed in the new polychromatic Ruskinian Gothic style, while the earlier St. Cloud reflected the more conservative French Second Empire tradition that was beginning to lose favor by 1875. Extensive research has not yet uncovered the architect of the Alexandra, but its Ruskinian Gothic style it is very similar to that of the Berwick Hotel built later on Columbus Avenue (on the site of the empty parking lot adjacent to ""Charlie's Sandwich Shop"" and Holyoke Street), and the Albemarle Hotel, which survives today at the corner of Columbus Avenue and Clarendon Streets as low-income housing.",Hotel Alexandra,"1767 Washington Street, Boston, MA 02118",42.33641274,71.07747115,"Written by John Neale, Historian for the South End Historical Society",https://northeastern-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/velloreumashankar_y_northeastern_edu/Documents/INAM5983%20Interdisciplinary%20Special%20Topics%20-%20Mass%20Ave%20Coalition/History/Alexandra%20History/Hotel%20Alexandra%20-%20History%20John%20Neale.docx?d=w7ac2389c9a9647209da27b735674f9b5&csf=1&web=1&e=hmd6Uf,,

24,Boston Transcript advertisement for the Hotel Alexandra,1875,09/15/1875,"The original advertisement for the apartments in the Hotel Alexandra appeared in the Boston Transcript on September 15, 1875.  The name ""Alexandra"" was emphasized in bold face type, and undoubtedly refers to Princess Alexandra of England, then the wife of the Prince of Wales, who was later to become King Edward VII after the death of his mother Queen Victoria in 1901.  The Walworths were proud anglophiles who made it clear to all who knew them that they were descended from Sir William Walworth, lord mayor of London during the reign of King Richard II in the fourteenth century.   

 

The name Alexandra  was certainly meant to establish an aristocratic tone for the new building.  The advertisement makes it clear that the Walworths backed this royal name up with the latest amenities, including their own steam heating system: 

 

""Alexandra""   

Corner Washington Street and Chester Square.  Suites for families in the new and elegant building now being finished in the most thorough and first-class manner; eight rooms to each unit, with steam heat, bathing rooms, passenger elevator, etc., making it the most desirable for location and comfort in the city.  Parties desiring this popular mode of housekeeping should apply at once, as several suites are already leased.""

The elevator was actually not as convenient a feature as it first appeared.  One had to ascend the marble stairs from the street level entrance to the second floor to reach it, but from there it ran to the top floor.  It had a handsome cab with glass and burled walnut panels, with a bench across the back providing seating for the slow trip up, for it relied upon city water pressure driving an ingenious system of pulleys actuated by a cylinder in the basement that ran horizontally out to the city water main.

38,Residents of the Hotel Alexandra,1875-1900,,"Besides being an investment, the Alexandra may also have been created to provide an in-town home for principals of the Walworth Manufacturing Company.  One of the original residents was James J. Walworth himself.  He moved from his home in Newtonville to the Alexandra upon its completion in September of 1875, and he lived there until his death on April 28, 1896.  Being in his late 60's at the time of his move, Walworth probably appreciated the convenience of living on one floor.  The treasurer of the Walworth Manufacturing Company, Emil C. Hammer, also moved into the Alexandra with his wife Martha.  By 1890 Hammer had become co-owner of the Alexandra with Walworth, and was also Denmark's Consul in Boston.

39,Hotel Alexandra Occupancy,1875-1900,,"The eight suites found willing tenants quickly, and by November of 1875 the Alexandra was fully leased.  The apartments were luxurious by today's standards, consisting of approximately 2,000 square feet each.  They consisted of two drawing rooms connected by double doors, a formal dining room, two principal bedrooms, a kitchen, a bath, and a servant's bedroom.  Ceilings were uniformly almost 12 feet in height, with plaster crown moldings.  Marble-mantled coal grates provided additional heat and atmosphere, and glass transoms over the doors provided ventilation.  A mechanical dumbwaiter was accessible from the kitchen of each unit, making the delivery of groceries less difficult for servants.  Suites like these were designed to appeal to young couples and ""empty-nesters"" in the language of today's real estate market, giving rise to the nineteenth century expression that residential hotels were built for ""the newly wed and the nearly dead"". 

 

The Alexandra remained a prestigious address until the new elevated electric train was run past its front doors in 1900.  This noisy and unattractive intrusion altered the character of Washington Street for the next eight decades, and so began the Alexandra's years of decline.  Caleb Walworth had moved from his Blackstone Square house to Longwood (Brookline), where he died in 1894, at which point ownership of the Alexandra passed out of family hands.  After James Walworth's death in 1896 his widowed second wife Lydia left the Alexandra, ending the family's involvement with the building for all time.  

The twentieth century was not kind to the Alexandra or its immediate environs, but the renewal of Washington Street bodes well for its future.  Today, it remains a tarnished but wonderfully intact reminder of a time when people changed the way they lived in urban neighborhoods, shifting from the vertical life of the individual row house to the horizontal life and shared amenities of the modern apartment building.  It also embodies the fortunes of a prominent South End family and its rise to success on the wave of nineteenth century technology and manufacturing that so characterized the builders of the South End.

42,Hotel Alexandra History,,,"The Hotel Alexandra, located at the busy corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Washington Street, is one of the South End's most prominent buildings, but it is also one of the least understood and appreciated.  Boarded up for decades, its history has never been researched in any detail, but recent events have put it back in the news and made an examination of its past clearly overdue. 

Years of neglect, failed businesses, a series of disastrous fires, and a break-in by a group of advocates for the homeless, and more recently, the failure to begin development by the current owner have kept the former luxury apartment building in the news, but for all the wrong reasons.  Now, supposedly for sale, its time may finally have arrived as the last few undeveloped parcels on Washington Street have been targeted by real estate developers.   

Even a cursory look at the Alexandra reveals it to be a very handsome building that is in dire need of a bath.  The beautiful red and buff-colored sandstone facade is blackened by more than a century of soot, although a recent cleaning has revealed its true colors.  The current owner leased out and painted the store fronts with the advice of the South End Landmark District Commission staff, revealing them to be among the most striking cast-iron Victorian store fronts in Boston.  Their intricate neo-gothic detail is set off by bands of color that match the stonework above.
